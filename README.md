The script in this git repository can be used (on a sufficiently old linux
system) to extract LÃ“VE binaries, and turn them into a portable build in
various different formats.

This project is split up into multiple parts, and each part is responsible for
a different build. Note that the `tarball` build is used as a base for the
other builds.

## tarball ##
`tarball` contains a build script that extracts the love version currently
installed on the system together with its dependencies to form a portable
build. It also creates a small wrapper script that does the correct search path
manipulations to be able to run the build.

Lastly, it contains the icon and a stubbed desktop file.
